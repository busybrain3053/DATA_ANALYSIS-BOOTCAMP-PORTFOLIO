## Overview  

This workbook introduced the foundations of **data analysis and automation** using Microsoft Excel.  
It combined essential spreadsheet skills with an understanding of **data protection, governance, and ethical handling of information**.  
Throughout the exercises, I worked with retail and customer datasets to perform analysis, automate workflows, and present insights in a clear, data-driven format.

## Objectives  

- Apply advanced Excel formulas to clean, sort, and analyse large datasets  
- Use **VLOOKUP** and **XLOOKUP** to search, compare, and merge data across sheets  
- Create **PivotTables** and use the **SWITCH** function to categorise results  
- Develop **Macros** to automate repetitive analytical tasks  
- Understand and apply principles of GDPR, FOIA, and the Data Protection Act 2018

## Workbook Structure  

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Day 1 – Data Laws and Ethics** | Explored GDPR, FOIA, DPA 2018, and the Computer Misuse Act, identifying how they impact data collection, storage, and sharing. |
| **Day 2 – Data Sorting and Formulas** | Organised retail sales data using **SUM**, **AVERAGE**, and **SORT** functions to calculate commission totals and averages. |
| **Day 3 – PivotTables and Categorisation** | Built PivotTables to summarise regional sales trends and used the **SWITCH** function to classify performance bands. |
| **Day 4 – Lookup and Reference Functions** | Applied **VLOOKUP** and **XLOOKUP** to match datasets, retrieve missing fields, and validate records between worksheets. |
| **Day 5 – Excel Macros and Automation** | Recorded and edited **Macros** to automate formatting, repetitive calculations, and report generation tasks. |

## Outcome  

This workbook demonstrates my ability to combine technical precision with ethical awareness in Excel-based analysis.  
I developed efficient methods to automate repetitive work, perform complex lookups across datasets, and present results in a structured, visual, and policy-compliant format.  
These skills laid the groundwork for scalable, repeatable analysis in later projects involving Power BI, SQL, and Python.
