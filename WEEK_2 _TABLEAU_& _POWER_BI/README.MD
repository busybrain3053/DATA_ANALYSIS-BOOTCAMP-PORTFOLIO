## Overview  

This workbook focused on transforming raw datasets into **clear, interactive visual stories** using **Tableau** and **Microsoft Power BI**.  
Through the analysis of real-world data — including **Spotify streaming trends** and **global health indicators** — I learned to design dashboards that highlight key performance insights, uncover patterns, and communicate findings effectively to a professional audience.

The exercises bridged technical design and analytical storytelling, combining statistical interpretation with creative presentation to deliver accessible, evidence-based insights for decision-makers.

## Objectives  

- Learn and compare different Tableau versions (Public, Desktop, Cloud, Server)  
- Build and publish dashboards visualising financial, health, and demographic trends  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis using Tableau and Power BI visual tools  
- Use map charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to interpret global data  
- Design professional reports using Power BI Labs (data loading, transformation, and dashboard creation)

## Workbook Structure  

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Day 1 – Introduction to Tableau** | Compared Tableau Public, Desktop, Server, and Cloud. Created a sample dashboard using the **EMSI_JobChange_UK** dataset with bar and map charts showing job change percentage by city. |
| **Day 2 – Spotify Data Analysis** | Analysed global Spotify dataset to explore **genre popularity, artist performance, and danceability correlations**. Created scatter plots showing the relationship between popularity and song characteristics. |
| **Day 2 – Health Data Analysis** | Explored health and demographic data, identifying relationships between **BMI, life expectancy, population growth, and cancer rates**. Created regional heatmaps and timeline visuals for trend analysis. |
| **Day 3 – Power BI Lab 1** | Completed **“Get Data in Power BI Desktop”**, importing datasets from multiple sources. Learned how to connect, clean, and model data efficiently. |
| **Day 3 – Power BI Lab 2** | Transformed and loaded datasets for analysis, applying calculated fields, column transformations, and model relationships. |
| **Day 4 – Power BI Lab 8: Report Design** | Designed a complete Power BI report including visuals, slicers, and key performance metrics. Practised alignment, colour consistency, and storytelling through visuals. |
| **Day 4 – Power BI Lab 12: Dashboard Creation** | Published an interactive Power BI dashboard combining multiple report pages into a unified analytical view. Demonstrated KPI tracking and layout design. |

## Insights and Findings  

- **Spotify Trends:** Pop and Dance genres consistently dominated global popularity, with higher danceability scores directly correlating with listener engagement.  
- **Health Analysis:** Discovered strong relationships between **BMI and life expectancy**, and identified **regional disparities** in cancer reporting — likely influenced by healthcare access and data quality.  
- **Population Growth Patterns:** Africa and Asia showed rapid growth rates, highlighting areas of future healthcare demand and infrastructure need.
