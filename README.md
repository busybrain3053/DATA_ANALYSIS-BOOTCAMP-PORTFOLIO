## Learning Journey  

The bootcamp built my ability to work across every stage of the data pipeline from raw input to polished insights.  
I developed a strong understanding of both the technical and ethical dimensions of analytics, learning to present data visually, interpret trends critically, and communicate findings effectively.  

Each module advanced my practical knowledge, culminating in a confident ability to work across **Excel, SQL, Power BI, Azure, and Python** for modern data analysis.

## Next Steps  

I am continuing to develop my analytical portfolio by exploring finance and health datasets that connect economic indicators with human outcomes.  
My goal is to use these insights to drive better decision-making in real-world business and policy contexts.
