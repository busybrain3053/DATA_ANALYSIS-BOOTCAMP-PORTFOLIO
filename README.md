## Overview  

This repository showcases my journey through an eight-week Data Analyst Bootcamp, where I learned to transform raw data into meaningful insights using **Excel, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Azure Cloud, and Python**.  
Each folder represents a completed weekly module that builds upon the previous one, showing my progression from spreadsheet analysis to coding, cloud integration, and visual storytelling.  

The bootcamp focused on **financial, health, and economic datasets**, analysing global GDP performance and health indicators to develop data-driven insights.
