## Overview  

This repository documents my complete journey through an **8-week Data Analyst Bootcamp**, where I mastered the end-to-end process of data analytics ‚Äî from cleaning and structuring datasets to creating automated visual dashboards and deploying secure cloud architectures.  

Each folder represents a different technical domain I explored during the course, showing the progression of my analytical, technical, and storytelling skills.  

The projects focus on **finance**, **health**, and **digital inclusion**, using real-world data to uncover insights about performance, inequality, and opportunity.

## Learning Journey  

This programme refined how I approach data ‚Äî not just technically, but critically and ethically.  
I learned to view datasets as stories that connect finance, health, and digital opportunity, and to use data analytics as a bridge between technology and decision-making.  

Each module layered new capabilities: from Excel logic and SQL relationships to Power BI dashboards, Python automation, and Azure integration.  
By the end, I developed a **full-stack analytical workflow** ‚Äî taking data from raw source to insight-ready visualisation.

---

## Next Steps  

I‚Äôm continuing to build projects that explore the intersection of **financial analysis**, **health data**, and **digital inclusion**, applying advanced analytics techniques to understand how connectivity and opportunity interact globally.
